## 💡 Idea <a name = "idea"></a>

We just checkout from `master` branch, and create more challenge for practice.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write as much scenario as possible.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) in watch mode. Read the
output and play around with it.

**Your goal will be to go into each test, swap the final version for the
exercise version in the import, and make the tests pass**
