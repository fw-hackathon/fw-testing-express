## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem
statement. While there are several options for doing this, the following is a
simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or “to be” state of the
  process or product. At large, this section should illustrate what the expected
  environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or “as is” state of the
  process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if
  the problem is not fixed or improved upon. This includes costs associated with
  loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to
understand the problem and elicit requirements that will lead to a winning
solution.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been completed, and
understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the
  method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and
  conclusions of your project, and if appropriate, describe how these
  limitations could point to the need for further research.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and
about what your project can achieve in the future.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See
[deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live
system.

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) in watch mode. Read the
output and play around with it.

**Your goal will be to go into each test, swap the final version for the
exercise version in the import, and make the tests pass**

## Helpful Emoji 🐨 💰 💯 🦉 📜 💣 🚨

Each exercise has comments in it to help you get through the exercise. These fun
emoji characters are here to help you.

- **Kody the Koala Bear** 🐨 will tell you when there's something specific you
  should do
- **Marty the Money Bag** 💰 will give you specific tips (and sometimes code)
  along the way
- **Hannah the Hundred** 💯 will give you extra challenges you can do if you
  finish the exercises early.
- **Olivia the Owl** 🦉 will give you useful tidbits/best practice notes and a
  link for elaboration and feedback.
- **Dominic the Document** 📜 will give you links to useful documentation
- **Berry the Bomb** 💣 will be hanging around anywhere you need to blow stuff
  up (delete code)
- **Alfred the Alert** 🚨 will occasionally show up in the test failures with
  potential explanations for why the tests are failing.
